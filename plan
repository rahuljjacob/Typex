plugboard - done
stator - randomized wheel (options are selected during input)
rotor - class -- init function takes setting of initial position and count for rotation of the rotor
				 first rotor will take count of 1
				 second and third rotor will take between 4 and 7
				 when (count == 4 or 7) (depends of the rotor) --> next(rotor)
				 issue fix :- rotor moves on the backpath from the reflector to the lampboard
